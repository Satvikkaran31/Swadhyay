    content: `Why do we say "Building your Career" – What do we really mean here? Can we really build it? is it a conscious process or accidental? does it go through phases? and what is eventually "THE GOAL or PURPOSE" of this career journey we undertake.

These are certain fundamental questions which most of us don't find easy to answer or may be don't give it a conscious thought.

Apart from the financial aspect, what do we seek from it?– Is it a sense of fulfillment, discovering our capabilities, learning new skills, growth, showcasing our talent, wealth or just the JOY in the process of creating something.

We can take analogies from the field of cricket and entertainment as relating to them is easier. Also careers of public figures are for everyone to see.

Cricket runs through various formats – For a 20-20 we need a different kind of a player but for a test match we need a different temperament altogether, while for one day the ask can be completely different. The same player can play differently in an IPL match and in the WORLD Cup the emotion can be completely different. While one may ball well in all formats but playing for the country can add emotion, more responsibility or fear to the player's experience. Sometimes the coach or captain is making a huge difference to team performance. Here Tendulkar is a living example of a great cricketer but not a "Great Captain".

Looking at the entertainment industry as well, the format we choose for creative expression can be writing, directing, performing or anything but the platform can be – bollywood or a theatre group or a dance troupe or a you tube or even netflix now. Some are even building it through tiktok these days! while what platform we choose can vary but the process of going through this journey does reflect a pattern.

This Pattern is what we call as the TRILOGY or TRINITY of Career building –Watching closely everyone's career goes through a phase of "Creation, Maintenance, Dissolution and Rediscovery". However long or successful one's career may be but a few fundamentals do remain consistent. The time in each zone may vary but the cycle to it does seem imperative. A few pointers at every stage can enhance or enrich this experience. The time period of these patterns could vary from profession, to platforms, to person but if one can identify the same in their respective journey the transition to the next phase can also be much easier.

The Creation Phase: This is the phase when we begin the process of Career Building – We are willing to learn, willing to experiment, all enthusiasm, very open to be being guided – basically we are all raring to set the tuning of this journey. At this stage "Looking for the right mentors, anchors or taking inspiration can be most fruitful". If you find people you can look up to at this stage it adds to the experience. E.g. an actor can be very fortunate if s/he gets to work with a great but demanding director in the early stage of their careers. It helps in setting a benchmark for ourselves, inspiring us and enhances this phase of learning and experimenting in this period. 
It would be ideal to have more than one such person identified at this stage. These will be people we can turn to for advice, be our guides in managing different situations and challenges and keep us on the right track. Choose your mentors consciously as you are most vulnerable in this phase. Do variety of different projects at this stage as the more you do, the better you will understand your strengths. ASK questions & continue to ASK -"Don't Hesitate – You are learning" – TRY & TRY- "Don't hesitate you are learning". Don't say no to new experiences, new projects and opportunities of working with different people. After all you are learning. You are discovering your own self and starting to know your real liking, motivations and challenges in this period so make the most of it. Mostly the life stage also supports this phase to focus on this process of laying the foundation. 
MS Dhoni's professional journey as a raw talent to being the Indian Captain relates to this phase and he comes to mind most while thinking through the pattern.

Stage of Maintenance: This is a good phase to be in as Now - we are most comfortable being us.We have established a certain identity, defined our capabilities and built our credibility and set a clear direction to ourselves. During this phase we may also have added other dimensions to life which will evolve our priorities and engagements as well. While we have to continue to sustain and better our versions during this phase it is equally important to "Expand our zone of influence and have a stronger outreach in this phase". Focus on understanding wider contexts, establishing broader networks and looking beyond our function to the overall organization or even the Sector or even beyond. Build your insights on influences/disruptions during this phase. Dhoni helped Indian cricket reach heights, provided stability and stay put as a guide, captain expanding his own influence across the Cricket board, took up IPL captain-ship and tested all formats during this time.

The phase of Dissolution and Rediscovery go Hand in hand: What we have created, built and established can only be dissolved while rediscovering and that's the reason why these two phases go hand in hand. Dissolution could result through age, an industry disruption or having a different internal need altogether for us to find fulfillment in our work. Seasoned players turn into coaches, CEO's turn into mentors, investors, guides or assume a much wider cause altogether (e.g. Many respected industry veterans like Nandan Nilekani; Pramath Sinha, Pramod Bhasin, Ashish Dhawan, Amit Chandra and many others have assumed a much wider role in this period. Reinventing ourselves, finding a bigger dimension or giving back to our sectors or nation all is achievable in this phase. Again Dhoni came as a living example -he knew when to slowly start distancing from some format to continue working as a team member and his return from World Cup to the Indian Army training camp just enhances the beauty of his transition and rediscovery.

Whatever the phase we are in, towards the end of this whole journey how we PLAY "TRULY DOES MATTER". Given this journey is also our OPPORTUNITY of touching lives in many ways at whichever phase, lets decide not to MISS IT in our Early career itself!. There are many with us on this journey so know that we are not on it ALONE and also know that's why "THE END PURPOSE DOES MATTER'".`

    content: `When 'collective consciousness' desires, the impact is profound. In the ever-evolving ecosystem—marked by increasing ambiguity, a dynamic environment, shifting priorities, and new discoveries—maintaining a common sense of purpose consistently and by conscious choice is never easy.

Focusing from individuals, to teams, to organizations, and finally to a systemic level is one of the most complex challenges in today's economic and social ecosystem. Coaching works across all these levels, and its systemic application is being deeply explored worldwide. Group dynamics and interdependencies within a Board have a direct impact on organizational success or failure and cannot be ignored.

Boards and Advisory Boards bring a wealth of experience, diversity, and best practices into the boardroom. The challenge lies in leveraging this richness to benefit the organization and the larger ecosystem. Effective facilitation, alignment, and systemic coaching interventions can be powerful tools in this process.

Recent research highlights how leadership coaching not only improves performance but also correlates with stronger business and shareholder value. Organizations at critical phases—pre-IPO, growth, crisis, M&A, or regulatory challenges—have seen positive impact, alignment, and co-ownership through such interventions.

The 5Cs of Effective Board Coaching & Facilitation:

1. Core Purpose – Facilitate a safe environment where members can collaborate effectively and engage in meaningful or difficult conversations. Alignment on core purpose establishes ownership and ensures consistency of agenda.

2. Collective Value – Help members recognize their joint expertise, networks, and beliefs. This deepens their sense of strength as a Board and shapes strategic insights for both the organization and the broader ecosystem.

3. Contribution Zones – Identify individual strengths and clarify expectations. Establishing "go-to" members for critical situations creates role clarity and enhances collaboration.

4. Co-Visioning – Enable the Board to co-create and envision a roadmap with clarity. Linking individual roles to collective goals sharpens focus and ensures alignment with organizational and sectoral outcomes.

5. Conscious Change – Once the first four Cs are addressed, Boards become receptive and ready to evolve. Coaching interventions at this stage can amplify change and position Boards as real drivers of transformation.`

    content: `Evolving & Appraising Boards in current times – Desirable or a Necessity?
As the unprecedented crisis continues to stare at almost all sectors and the executive leadership
bandwidth is being significantly challenged to the sudden new “ASKs” and “Challenges” of
business and organisations - the deeper role of Boards has assumed a critical importance in the
last few months.

Board Chairs and the CEOs have never before needed to work as a “ONE” so as to respond
effectively and orchestrate organisations to remain relevant, functional and sustainable.
Many strategy, management and leadership consulting firms have emphasized and highlighted
on some significant areas of attention like crisis based and agile leadership, liquidity
management, health and safety orientation, resilience, will to reform & restructure, effective
communication with employee & stakeholders, risk assessment at varied levels including
cybersecurity and most importantly evaluating effective digitisation & usage of AI/ML are key
requirements to sail through this uncertain phase in most sectors.

Many Boards have surely been a great help in effectively steering through some of these new
found challenges. CEOs and executive leadership teams also found support in Boards as sounding
boards and were able to leverage their strengths in many of these areas.
In a recent Board survey by Executive Access with over 200 companies across 8 sectors including
consumer & consumer tech, financial services, professional services, healthcare, technology,
media & telecom and manufacturing amongst others some interesting revelations came up like:
a. Most organisations still have representation of women on boards mostly due to regulation
rather than an intent of creating a real balance. With an exception of TMT and to some extent
Pharma & healthcare, most sectors still have less than 20% of women representation on their
Boards, infact closer to just 10-15%.

b. Nature of traditional Board structures has not evolved much in the last decade despite some
real dynamic changes in the external environment.

c. Digital leadership and some representation of younger leaders though being adopted by a
few mainstream corporates, most organisations have ignored adding Board strengths from
these segments as well.

d. Non profit boards have hardly renewed themselves and added bandwidth to widen the
representation or composition.

Reflecting on how critical it was during this period to leverage Boards’ strengths for key
organization and business objectives, I feel it’s imperative to appraise the strengths of Boards
consciously, strategically and relook at the composition to ensure there is a balance of key
quotients reflected through boards in the best interest of business and organizations. A right
Board composition and expectations setting with clarity can go a long way to make them more
effective as the current scenario requires them to go beyond call of duty and step into different
shoes.

A few indicative Quotients that could form a fundamentals lens for Board Appraisal and
composition can go a long way to create a strong, balanced and responsive Board.

1. Agile Leadership Quotient: has emerged as one of the most used and critical leadership
requirement during this phase. The best interpretation that one could come up for this kind of
leadership is “RESPONDING TO THE PRESENT CONTEXT”which means if you have leaders who can
retain their composure and are able to effectively and strategically respond by keeping the
present context in focus and plan a response around that – organisations can move forward with
clarity and agility as per the need of the hour. Board members and CEOs who stayed least affected
by variables of fear, anxiety or uncertainty and could stay focussed on keeping the organisations
relevant have been a huge asset for any organisation in this phase.

2. Courage & Commitment Quotient: Is the Board feeling more committed and concerned
towards contributing to the Organizations survival in this scenario? Are they putting up a
courageous, brave and committed front to help face existing challenges alongside the executive
teams? Ineffective Boards may instead add to the fear, hurry or anxiousness in the process of
decision making for Executive teams as well. While it’s understood that most top teams may not
have a straight answer to surmounting the challenges, however it’s equally important to show
up with conviction and courage. Any other approach would only have other repercussions rather
than a solution orientation. Commiting and partnering to identify ways to contribute in different
areas of their expertise together with the Executive top teams is the need of hour. It’s imperative
to have committed and courageous boards who fearlessly address larger issues for the
organization, ask the right questions and show commitment to contribute with their time and
availability. This would help ease a lot of performance pressure from CEOs / Executive leadership
and also help them stay focused knowing they are not alone in taking fearless decisions towards
short term strategy and moving fast on those levers.

3. Corporate governance & Risk mitigation: When Boards anticipate risks while taking the larger
external context apart from the internal ones – like reputational risks, market risks amongst
others and place caution before executive teams it can go a long way in managing and mitigating
them well. Governance issues are critical in all phases for businesses and in these times especially
reputational risks amongst others are important for organisations to sustain their long-term
presence, brands or even add value in different ways.Finding sectoral leadership through boards
apart from policy and reforms based issues with Government is another area where boards could
truly help take lead. Collaboration with competition on common issues and making a larger
inclusive attempt by partnering effectively with the government as well on critical issues could
bring relief in solving complex issues facing institutions at a larger level. If Boards can take the
lead for championing some of the external ecosystem based challenges it may help sometimes in
unanticipated ways. Risks tackled well through external circle of influence can truly help ease lot
of pressures both at organization and sectoral levels.

4. Customer & Creative Quotient: Can Boards support and appreciate an urgent need for a
transformation, restructuring, merger or acquisition, a technology based evolution if needed in
the best interest of the customer and company? These are tough decisions and need to be
approached cautiously by top teams and investors, however when they have a buy-in from
Boards it makes it easier. Boards can also play a critical through an ear on the ground and present
foresights on some of these critical decisions. Innovation and Creativity are very important ASKs
from organizations to have a sustained connect on ground !
Board’s appreciation of wearing the customer lens will help faster response through change or
innovative actionables by organisations. If the business largely caters to the youth segment it may
be helpful to think of having younger representation on Boards as well for a fresh perspective.

5. Communication Quotient: With an environment of anxiety, fear and uncertainty the
stakeholders needing engagement has significantly increased for leadership teams in Corporates
across most or almost all sectors. Communicating with clarity and carrying the same message and
intent by the Board and Executive Leadership with various stakeholders including Employees,
Customers, Regulators, Investors & shareholders, Government, Vendors and partners is of
utmost importance. There are no clear answers with most top teams given the variables
associated with the situation, however if Boards and Executive teams can together make an effort
in making all stakeholders aware and getting their commitment to partner and evolve towards
solutions – it’s another critical area where Boards can add real value.
When critical stakeholders observe Board involvement they also gather strength and trust in the
venture. Acting as a spokesperson for organizations and sectors is a key area to leverage Boards
strength.

6. Coaching & Mentoring Quotient : When a Board assumes a role of a Coach and a Mentor to
the Executive teams they act on multiple aspects of the organisation’s evolution and response.
The CEO finds a sounding board, a trust worthy partner who they can go to in times of crisis and
struggle, find their anchors and support system and don’t feel lonely in their journey. This can do
wonders for the organization as the Leadership gets clarity and strength to take key strategic
decisions. When the Board behaviors is mentoring oriented rather than intervening it creates
adequate space for executive teams to go with their plans full force and with a free mind and
confidence knowing they have a safe anchor. When Boards are positively critical they act as a
Light House driving awareness and clarity while steering the ship / organization forward. Board
behaviors when represent an understanding, inclusive and adaptive approach it creates
tremendous space for organizations to evolve more effectively.

Leveraging the Board strengths in a strategic way along with the Executive teams and
orchestrating this partnership well could form a key priority for the Chairman and CEO together
as they will be the primary people expected to provide direction and clarity on way forward for
the institution. It hence makes it critical for them to be well tuned on this journey together to set
right expectations from both Boards and delivering teams.

But in the end appraising and best leveraging the strength of the current Board and top teams on
above lines is desirable or necessary is best left to the decision makers! `

    content:`In the last two years, leadership traits have significantly evolved with compassion and empathy topping
the chart when it comes to ideal leadership qualities. This seems like a significant shift up, almost like
moving up on the Maslow’s hierarchy!
Per a recent research, almost 77% organizations are witnessing a leadership gap in these times.
Compassionate and empathetic leaders have become necessary asks from leaders, not just in the
corporate sector but also in other fields including social sector, development institutions,medical
institutions, education leaders and of course governments.Thinking beyond one’s own institution and
taking a more holistic and collective perspective has become pertinent.
Over the years, academic institutions, corporates, consulting firms, and search firms have been
researching behaviors of leaders and correlating these to values, behaviors, beliefs, vision, mission and
mindsets. As seen in Fig 1, the list of leadership traits that are valued by many of them have seen
changes over the years. Human centered leadership has found its rightful way to the top in these times.
Compassion finding its way to the top of the ladder is a great indicator as many other aspects get
encircled naturally in the same. Systemic collaboration, collective orientation can only find its way

through compassionate leaders. The younger generation’s success ride through innovative ways of
solving for human challenges across fields without fear with an unflinching spirit is amazing to witness in
this era especially in India and presents a lot of promise.
Scriptures, leaders and successful organizations
Our Indian scriptures gave a unique perspective while mentioning ideal traits for a leader/King. They
mention about an unflinching trust in the human consciousness as the single most important factor
while leading a team through trying situations as that keeps hope alive amongst teams .They also
emphasize on foresight, being truthful, empathetic and quick decision making while responding to
situations keeping everyone’s welfare in mind as most important traits for a leader who shoulders
significant responsibilities.
It also makes it interesting to learn how new age leaders with most successful and powerful
organisations like Alphabet has Sundar Pichai at the forefront- his understated, polite, unflappable,
unflinching, unchanged by success and humility based approach find a lot of resonance not just amongst
employees but also the millions he inspires in the corporate world and otherwise. Following the concept
of distributed leadership and coaching as intrinsic to their culture sets a great example to follow through
for so many institutions as well!
Large Indian conglomerates like TATAs, Wipro, Mahindra’s, Birla amongst others have a commonality
around embracing a larger purpose, sense of mission, integrity, transparency and building trust as
integral to their leadership, values and mission. It is interesting to observe their leaders’ participation on
socio-economic fronts and the deep engagement in nation building efforts. CSR law, which no other
country apart from India has brought in, has played an important role for a deeper dialogue amongst
the development eco-system and has played a key role to help see the extension and convergence of
businesses and societies and bring deeper awareness around the interdependencies.
When leaders themselves choose to be Coaches or undertake Coaching to build deeper awareness they
evolve.It helps them move forward on their internal journey leading to influence a significant shift on
multiple fronts.

The SEAT of Awareness
When a leader is able to visualize themselves as separate from their situation, they are more likely to
give a response which is most conducive and appropriate in that situation. Their ability to be resilient
and fearless could only be a result of not identifying with the situation but externalizing it and develop
the awareness about what is in their direct control or influence and what is beyond the same.
Awareness becomes the innermost and cleanest canvas or seat from where thoughts emerge within
oneself. It is the present moment which is uncolored by the past or anxious about the future and
thereby most focused on the context - in other words the being self rather than the conditioned self.
Empathy, deep listening, understanding and even agility all reside here on this canvas of awareness.
Without staying in awareness none of the above traits can find their seat. Their ability to map the
people organisations mind is a possibility when a leader themselves can sit on different chairs, gather

varied perspectives and takes decision with this awareness. It is through awareness they can connect
and respond but not react to even the most trying and complex situations.
Coaching as a process helps internalize many of these in Leaders.
When rooted in awareness leadership seems effortless!`
